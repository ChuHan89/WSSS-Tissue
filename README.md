We present a tissue semantic segmentation model for histopathology images using only patch-level classification labels, which greatly saves the annotation time for pathologists. Multi-layer pseudo-supervision with progressive dropout attention is proposed to reduce the information gap between patch-level and pixellevel labels. And a classification gate mechanism is introduced to reduce the false-positive rate.
