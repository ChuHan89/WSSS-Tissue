# Multi-Layer Pseudo-Supervision for Histopathology Tissue Semantic Segmentation using Patch-level Classification Labels
![outline](workflow.png)

## Introduction
This paper is now under review, we will release the code after acceptance.

## Dataset
We have released both datasets via Google Drive ([LUAD-HistoSeg](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E3Yei3Or3xJXukHIybZAgochxfn6FJpr?usp=sharing) and [BCSS-WSSS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iS2Z0DsbACqGp7m6VDJbAcgzeXNEFr77?usp=sharing).).
We would like to thank Amgad et al. for this excellent dataset. The original BCSS dataset can be download at this link [BCSS-link](https://github.com/PathologyDataScience/CrowdsourcingDataset-Amgadetal2019).
