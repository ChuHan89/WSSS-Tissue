## Introduction
The implementation of **[Multi-Layer Pseudo-Supervision for Histopathology Tissue Semantic Segmentation using Patch-level Classification Labels](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2022.102487)**.

## Abstract
Tissue-level semantic segmentation is a vital step in computational pathology. Fully-supervised models have already achieved outstanding performance with dense pixel-level annotations. However, drawing such labels on the giga-pixel whole slide images is extremely expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we use only patch-level classification labels to achieve tissue semantic segmentation on histopathology images, finally reducing the annotation efforts. We propose a two-step model including a classification and a segmentation phases. In the classification phase, we propose a CAM-based model to generate pseudo masks by patch-level labels. In the segmentation phase, we achieve tissue semantic segmentation by our propose Multi-Layer Pseudo-Supervision. Several technical novelties have been proposed to reduce the information gap between pixel-level and patch-level annotations. As a part of this paper, we introduce a new weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) dataset for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD-HistoSeg). We conduct several experiments to evaluate our proposed model on two datasets. Our proposed model outperforms two state-of-the-art WSSS approaches. Note that we can achieve comparable quantitative and qualitative results with the fully-supervised model, with only around a 2% gap for MIoU and FwIoU. By comparing with manual labeling on a randomly sampled 100 patches dataset, patch-level labeling can greatly reduce the annotation time from hours to minutes.

## Datasets
We have released both datasets via Google Drive ([LUAD-HistoSeg](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E3Yei3Or3xJXukHIybZAgochxfn6FJpr?usp=sharing) and [BCSS-WSSS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iS2Z0DsbACqGp7m6VDJbAcgzeXNEFr77?usp=sharing).).
We would like to thank Amgad et al. for this excellent dataset. The original BCSS dataset can be download at this link [BCSS-link](https://github.com/PathologyDataScience/CrowdsourcingDataset-Amgadetal2019).

## Checkpoints

### Run the whole pipeline
- In this work, our pipeline include 3 part~(Stage 1, PM generation, Stage2). You can directly run run_pipeline.sh to complete the three-part training and test.
- [Note] To run the whole pipeline, you need to specify the dataset related hyperparameters. Please see the command in run_pipeline.sh.
```
bash run_pipeline.sh
```
### Run each step: 
- The whole pipeline of our model includes the step of classification model training, muleti-layer pseudo masks  generation, and segmentation model training. You can use following scripts to run each step.
- [Note] Please specify the argument in the command. You can also check run_pipeline.sh to see more details.
#### 1、Train the classification model with the image-level label: 

```
python 1_train_stage1.py --dataset luad --trainroot datasets/LUAD-HistoSeg/train/ --testroot dataset/LUAD-HistoSeg/test/ --max_epoches 20 --batch_size 20
```
#### 2、Generate multi-layers pesudo mask by classification model: 

```
python 2_generate_PM.py --dataroot datasets/LUAD-HistoSeg --dataset luad --weights checkpoints/stage1_checkpoint_trained_on_luad.pth
```
#### 3、Train the segmentation model with multi-layer pesudo masks: 

```
python 3_train_stage2.py --dataset luad --dataroot datasets/LUAD-HistoSeg --epochs 20 -- Is_GM True --resume_stage1 checkpoints/stage1_checkpoint_trained_on_luad.pth --resume init_weights/deeplab-resnet.pth.tar
